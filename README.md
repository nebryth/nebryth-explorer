# Nebryth DAO

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Nebryth Protocol**

A governance module enabling NBYT token holders to participate in decentralized decision-making for the Nebryth Protocol ecosystem - an AI-powered blockchain platform.

## Overview

Nebryth DAO provides on-chain governance capabilities for the Nebryth Protocol, allowing community members to propose, vote on, and implement changes to the protocol. Built on Cosmos SDK, this DAO module ensures transparent and democratic control over protocol parameters, treasury management, and ecosystem development[web:63][web:64].

## Features

- **Proposal System**: Submit and vote on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and treasury allocations[web:56][web:65]
- **Token-Based Voting**: Voting power proportional to NBYT token holdings from the 250 million total supply[attached_file:1]
- **Treasury Management**: Community-controlled fund allocation for development and marketing initiatives[web:63]
- **Timelock Mechanisms**: Secure implementation delays for critical protocol changes[web:65]
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Enhanced security for high-impact decisions[web:64]

## Governance Structure

### Proposal Types

- **Protocol Upgrades**: Technical improvements and feature additions to Nebryth Protocol[web:56]
- **Parameter Changes**: Adjustments to gas fees, staking rewards, and network parameters[web:63]
- **Treasury Spending**: Fund allocation for development, marketing, and partnerships[web:65]
- **AI Integration**: Proposals for new AI-powered features and capabilities[web:64]

### Voting Process

1. **Proposal Submission**: Any NBYT holder can submit a proposal with a minimum stake requirement[web:63]
2. **Discussion Period**: 7-day community discussion phase[web:56]
3. **Voting Period**: 14-day voting window for all token holders[web:63]
4. **Execution**: Approved proposals implemented after timelock period[web:65]

## Technical Architecture

### Built With

- **Cosmos SDK**: Core blockchain framework[web:64]
- **Go**: Primary programming language for module development[web:56]
- **NBYT Token**: Native governance token (250M supply)[attached_file:1]
